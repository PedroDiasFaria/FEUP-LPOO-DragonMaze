# Dragon Maze

This project was our first contact with the java language. It was developed on our second year of college and it was used as a way for us to understand the modularity construction of a program and as a way to get us aquainted with java. In terms of development we followed a test driven development approach, where we started to test the basic logic of the game first and then started writting the code. 

The game has the following features :

* Playing the original 10*10 maze;
* Random generation of mazes (in need of refactoring);
* Playing with dragons that have their own movements and that can fall asleep;
* Saving/Loading games;
* Custom maze creation;

The first version of the game was made using only the command line interface, using letter inputs consumed with enters to move the character. Eventually, finished with the basic version of it, we upgraded the GUI with the swing widget toolkit for a better visual experience using some cool sprites.
